## 2024-04-02 - Testing headless playwright scripts
**Learning:** When testing Argenmap with Playwright in a headless environment, UI interactions (like clicking buttons that open modals) might fail due to visibility constraints or complex event logic.
**Action:** Use `page.evaluate()` to directly interact with the DOM elements via JavaScript (e.g., `document.getElementById('element-id').click()`) to bypass these issues.
